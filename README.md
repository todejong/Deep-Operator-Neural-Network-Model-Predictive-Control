# Deep Operator Neural Network Model Predictive Control

This repository contains supplementary code for the paper:  
**Deep Operator Neural Network Model Predictive Control**.

We demonstrate the use of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) and Multi-Step Deep Operator Networks (MS-DeepONets) in the context of Model Predictive Control (MPC) across three nonlinear dynamical systems.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each example system is contained in its own folder:

- `Van_der_Pol`
- `Four_tank`
- `Pendulum_on_cart`

Each folder includes:

- `DeepONet_simulation.ipynb` — Simulation and training using standard DeepONet  
- `MS_DeepONet_simulation.ipynb` — Simulation and training using MS-DeepONet
- `models.py` — Contains several pre defined neural network models
- `functions.py` — Contains several functions used in the code
- `data_standard/` — Stores data used/generated by the DeepONet_simulation notebook  
- `data_MS/` — Stores data used/generated by the MS_DeepONet_simulation notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepONet_MPC.git
cd DeepONet_MPC
```

2. Navigate to one of the example folders:

```bash
cd Van_der_Pol
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open and run all code blocks from top to bottom for either:
   - `DeepONet_simulation.ipynb` for standard DeepONet architecture  
   - `MS_DeepONet_simulation.ipynb` for the MS-DeepONet architecture  

---

## 📊 Examples

Each notebook will:

- Generate training and validation data 
- Train the respective DeepONet architecture  
- Run closed-loop MPC simulations 
- Save results to the corresponding `data_standard/` or `data_MS/` folder  
- Visualize simulation and training results
