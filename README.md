# Deep Operator Neural Network Model Predictive Control

This repository contains supplementary code for the paper:  
**Deep Operator Neural Network Model Predictive Control**.

We demonstrate the use of Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) and Multi-Step Deep Operator Networks (MS-DeepONets) in the context of Model Predictive Control (MPC) across three nonlinear dynamical systems.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each example system is contained in its own folder:

- `Van_der_Pol`
- `Four_tank`
- `Pendulum_on_cart`

Each folder includes:

- `DeepONet_simulation.ipynb` — Simulation and training using standard DeepONet  
- `MS_DeepONet_simulation.ipynb` — Simulation and training using MS-DeepONet  
- `data_standard/` — Stores data used/generated by the DeepONet notebook  
- `data_MS/` — Stores data used/generated by the MS-DeepONet notebook  

---

## 📦 Requirements

Python 3.11.7 is used for generating the examples together with the following packages:

- numpy  
- scipy  
- matplotlib  
- torch  
- tqdm  
- jupyter  

Install all dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DeepONet_MPC.git
cd DeepONet_MPC
```

2. Navigate to one of the example folders:

```bash
cd Van_der_Pol
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open and run either:
   - `DeepONet_simulation.ipynb` for standard DeepONet  
   - `MS_DeepONet_simulation.ipynb` for the MS-DeepONet architecture  

---

## 📊 Examples

Each notebook will:

- Train the respective DeepONet architecture  
- Run closed-loop MPC simulations  
- Save results to the corresponding `data_standard/` or `data_MS/` folder  
- Visualize predicted vs. true system trajectories
